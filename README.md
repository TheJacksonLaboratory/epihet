# epihet
Introduction

epiHet is a R package to calculate the intra-tumoral epigenetic heterogeneity and performing differentially epigenetic heterogeneity analysis from high-throughput bisulfite sequencing. epihet implements a biological network analysis workflow for transforming cancer type-specific differentially epigenetic heterogeneity loci into cancer-related biological function and clinical biomarker. 

How to use

The input bam file may be obtained from bisseq pipeline (https://pbtech-vc.med.cornell.edu/git/thk2008/bisseq/tree/master/) for aligning bisulfite sequencing reads.
